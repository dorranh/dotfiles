# nvim

Neovim configuration

This originally started out as an NvChad config and has since been ported over into a
more bespoke set of config that no longer depends on NvChad. Most of the keymaps follow
those from NvChad still though.

## Setup

Most dependencies are managed with Lazy and Mazon (see :MasonToolsInstall). For the dashboard
you will want to also install [colorscript](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts).
